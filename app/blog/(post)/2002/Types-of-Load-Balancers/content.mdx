Types of Load Balancers (Explained for Devs & Engineers)

Load balancers aren’t just about “spreading traffic.” The type you choose controls how requests are routed, what layer they work on, and how much control you get. Here’s a breakdown based on how they’re used in real systems.

🔹 1. Layer 4 Load Balancers (Transport Layer)

These operate at the TCP/UDP level. They don’t care about HTTP, cookies, or headers — they just forward packets based on IP and port.

How it works:

Looks at source/destination IP + port

Routes traffic to backend instances

Examples:

AWS NLB

HAProxy (L4 mode)

LVS (Linux Virtual Server)

F5 (L4 mode)

Use when:

You need very high performance / low latency

You’re handling TCP/UDP services (gRPC, game servers, VoIP, etc.)

You don’t need to inspect HTTP headers or URLs

🔹 2. Layer 7 Load Balancers (Application Layer)

These understand HTTP/HTTPS and can inspect the content of requests.

They can do things like:

Route by URL path (/api vs /admin)

Route by hostname (example.com vs api.example.com)

Add/modify headers

Handle sticky sessions or JWT headers

Terminate SSL/TLS

Examples:

AWS ALB

NGINX

Apache HTTP Server

Traefik

Envoy

HAProxy (L7 mode)

Use when:

You're routing microservices by URL

You need SSL termination

You do canary releases / A/B testing

You want sticky sessions

🔹 3. Hardware Load Balancers

Physical, enterprise-grade devices used by banks, telecoms, and on-prem data centers.

Vendors:

F5

Citrix ADC

Radware

Why use them?

Extremely high throughput

Built-in DDoS protection

Guaranteed uptime (SLA)

Legacy infrastructure

Downside: Expensive and less flexible than cloud/software options.

🔹 4. Software Load Balancers

Deployed on VMs, containers, or bare metal. More flexible and DevOps-friendly.

Popular tools:

NGINX

HAProxy

Traefik

Envoy

Caddy

Apache

Use when:

You're running on-prem or hybrid

You want full config control

You’re integrating with Kubernetes or Docker

🔹 5. Global Server Load Balancers (GSLB / Anycast / Geo Load Balancing)

These handle traffic across multiple regions or data centers.

They decide routing based on:

User’s geographic location

Latency

Availability of regions

Disaster recovery

Examples:

AWS Route 53 latency/geo routing

Cloudflare Load Balancer

Google Cloud Cloud DNS + Traffic Director

Azure Traffic Manager

NS1

Use when:

You're serving users globally

You need regional failover

Multi-cloud or multi-data center setup

🔹 6. DNS Load Balancing

This isn’t “real-time” routing — it answers DNS queries with different IPs to spread the load.

Pros:

Simple and cheap

Works at large scale

Cons:

Slow failover due to DNS caching

No health checks at the connection level

Examples:

AWS Route 53

Cloudflare DNS

Akamai DNS

🔹 7. Reverse Proxy as Load Balancer

This is common in modern apps — a reverse proxy routes incoming traffic to internal services.

Examples:

NGINX

Traefik

Apache

Envoy

Caddy

Use when:

You need API gateway behavior

TLS termination

URL rewriting

Authentication / JWT / OAuth

🔹 8. Service Mesh Load Balancers (Intra-cluster)

Used inside Kubernetes or microservice architectures.

These don’t sit outside your app — they run as sidecars or part of the service mesh.

Examples:

Istio + Envoy

Linkerd

Consul Connect

Kuma

Use when:

You want mTLS between services

Circuit breaking, retries, traffic shadowing

Traffic splitting (canary releases)

Automatic service discovery
